This repository is focused on SQL programming.
I created a database for restaurant which has mulitiple food and beverage offerings.
There are multiple procedures and queries which help front end staff use the system.
The database is Boys-Codd(3.5NF) compliant.

Run the CreateDatabase file to create the database
To add the procedure to the database run all the scripts in the Procedures folder
To add the views run the scripts from the views folder
